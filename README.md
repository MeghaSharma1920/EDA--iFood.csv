Explore distributions, segment-wise preferences of customers, advertising expenses segments and performances, etc. Use different kinds of plotting, tables, and other summarization techniques to explore these relationships.

Explore offers_accepted/customer profile, customer_profile/amount spent on products relationship.

Explore bivariate or cross-segment relations such as, how deals, customer profile variables, and length of customer association with the company affects their behavior. Learn about cross-tabulation.

Explore what modeling opportunities you can create between the different variables. The key to doing it, try to think from the first principle.

For example, if you want to predict how the customer's spending on a household item will change based on their profile, it may very well be that a married man buys more fruits and groceries and waits for deal purchases more.
